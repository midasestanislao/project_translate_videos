      "[Music]what is going on guys welcome back intoday's video we're going to talk aboutocr which stands for optical characterrecognition and we're going to usepython in combination with tesseract inorder to extract text from images sowe're going to take images that containsome text on the site maybe on streetsigns and we're going to take imagesthat contain mainly text and then we'regoing to use ocr in order to extract thetext from the images and for this thefirst thing we need to do is we need toinstall tesseract it's an open sourceocr engine and you can find it ongithub.com tesseractocr tesseractand in here you can scroll down toinstalling tesseract and you can go toinstall tesseract via pre-build binarypackage if you want to do that and ifyou click on this you can scroll downwhere is it down here to ubuntu debianwindows and you can if you're on windowsclick just windows tesseract at ubmanheim and then you're going to get aninstaller for windows here by justclicking on the 64-bit for exampledownloading it running it i'm not goingto do that right now because i alreadyhave test direct installed now theimportant thing that you need to do hereis when you install it look at thedirectory it is going to be installed inand add this directory to the path soin my case i'm not sure where it wastesseractlet's just open the file location of theuninstalleropen file location there you go so wehave this tesseract ocr this is thelocation in my case so for me it's cprogram files test rec.ocrwhat you want to do is you want to go tothe environment variable so you want togo to edit the system environmentvariables and you want to click here onenvironment variables you want to go tothe path you want to edit the path andyou want to add a new entry with cprogram files tesseract ocrand what you also want to do is you wantto add a variable here called test dataunderscore prefix and this is going tobe the test data directory so inside ofthe tesseract ocr directory you havethis test data directory hereand uh in here you can download thelanguages so by default i think you onlyhave english you can download thetrained data files from the githubrepository so for example here i have uhthe german one if you're interested inhaving multiple languages but in orderto find them you need to have thisvariable hereall right so that's basically thetesseract installation what you alsoneed of course is you need pi tesseractbecause tesseract is not a python moduletesseract is the engine and if you wantto use it in python you have to installpi tesseract so you open up the commandline and you saypip install pitesseract like that and of course youcan also i think install tesseract heredirectly but for some reason doesn'twork as wellfor me so i would recommend installingit from the installer and adding it topath and then just using pi tesseractnow before we go into any of the pythoncode we're going to do everythingmanually with tesseract in the commandline so that you see how this basicallyworks and for this i have a bunch ofimages here for example here i have abasic image containing some text let mejust see if i'm not blocking it notreally so i can leave it like thatit's basically just a text with you knowjust just an image with basic text butof course we cannot select this this isstill an image we cannot just say copyand paste as text it is still part of animage in order to extract it this is ofcourse a very easy thing a very easytask we can use tesseract for this we'regoing to open up a command line andwe're going to navigate to the directorywhere this file is whatever it is inyour case i have a shortcut hereum[Music]and basically i'm interested in thistext.jpg file now how do i do this verysimple tesseractthen the image so textdot jpg and then std out to print theresult of the ocr extractionumonto the command lineso by doing that you can see hereinstructions and i get the text here asa result so this is a very simple thingbecause of course the image is quite uhstraightforward we have very well uhreadable textso let's take something that is not aseasy like logos for example here we havea bunch of different words let me justsee again if i'm blocking anything letme just make this a little bit smallerherewe can see different words here we cansee sony paypal microsoft some of themshould be recognized in order to see ifthat works we're just going to do thesame thing and we're going to apply thisonlogos.jpgand this is going to be a little bitmore messy as you see we can see herepaypal sony microsoft bosch and so onbut then a lot of stuff that doesn'treally make a lot of sense we can seenvidia here so it partly works probablynot and um this is the challenge of ocrbecause what we also have is we havecertain settings that we can use and forthis i'm going to copyand paste something that i have preparedhere this is just information so hereyou can see the so-called pagesegmentation modes and we're going totalk about them briefly in a second andwe also have the so-called ocr enginemodes that we can chooseso i'm not sure whyhereit is not green okay let me just addsome comment here in the topso that we havethis in green so here we have the pagesegmentation modes and here we have theocr engine modes and we can combinethese settings toget different results and how do we dothat we basically call tesseract andthen we specifythe individual settings so i can doagain the same thing and now i can sayin the enddash dash and then psm which stands forpage segmentation mode and a number fromthis list soi'm not even sure what's the default tobe honest but basically you can see whatthey do so 0says orientation and script detectionosd only then we have for examplesomething like assume a single uniformblock of text this might be useful foran image like thisit doesn't make sense for an image likethis because that is not a uniformblock of text that just doesn't makesense then we also have the same thingfor vertically align basically we'rechoosing a setting to say okay i giveyou this little hint that this image isbasically just containing one uniformblock of text and this makes it easierfor the algorithm or for the process tobe done in a in a good way and otherwisehere we have for example automatic pagesegmentationuhfind as much text as possible and norprotect no particular order this is alsopossible maybe we're going to get betterresults with that so let's apply to thelogos again with psm11and you can see that we get a little bitmore we can see vodafone here i think wedidn't have vodafone beforeright yes so it recognized something newhere uh it just finds more and sometimesit finds even stuff that's not there soum that's of course the trade-off andthis is just something i wanted to showto you we're not gonna go through allthe settings but we can choose thesepsms these page segmentation modes toget better results if we know somethingfor example if we know there's just onesingle world uh word then we're going toget that maybe we can try this on thelogos to see how it failsum there you go we got seats welldoesn't make a lot of sense but uh thisis what you get from the different modesthen we also have the ocr engine modesandhere we basically decide what model isbeing used for example we can sayuhneural nets or legacy engine i'm noteven sure what legacy engine meansbut lstm is long short-term memory uhbasically a recurrent neural network youcan choose the type ofengine that we want to use and you cancombine it if you want to use it youbasically say addition in addition topsm or also without psm dash dash oemocr engine mode and then zero to threeso for example we can go with threewe can go with twocouldn't load any languages okay thisfailed for some reason and this bringsme also to the next point by the way wecan also specify the language so i cansay dash land choose uh deu for germanand it's going to try to find likegerman words but yeah doesn't reallymake a lot of uh doesn't really make anydifference in this caseso those are the basic settings this ishow you use tesseract by the way justone thing that i want to show you hereas well you can use tesseractumneural deer there you go you can usetesseract also forsaving into text files so we can saytesseract and then text.jpg andtext.textso this is going to save the result intotext dot textso we can open this up not here here andyou can see that we have the result in atext file so this is how you usetesseract in the command line all rightnow let's go ahead and do all of this inpython first of all we're going toimport pi tesseract that we installedbefore we're going to also import pilldot image and we're going to importcv2 now if you don't have theselibraries you need to install via thecommand lineuh pip installpillow and open cv dash python like thatthose are the two libraries hereand what we're going to do now is we'regoing to start by creating our config sowe're going to say my config equals andthen r and string and we're going to saydash dash psm and dash oem and now wecan choose some numbersumbasically for the first image we'regoing to work with text.jpg and for thiswe're going toassume a single uniform block of text sowe're going to choose 6 as the psmand we're going to go with the defaultoem 3 based on what's what is availablethis is our config and now we can use asimple function called image to stringto get the text so we're going to saytext equalspi tesseract dot image to string andwe're going to pass hereuh pill dot imagedot openand we're going to pass image dotactually not image textdot jpgand as a configwe're going to pass my configand then we can just print the text likethisso this is enough andas a result you can see we get the textthat is stored in the image that is partof the imageso that's a very simple thing and fortext jpeg it works obviously very wellwe can go withlogos.jpg now now for this probably weshould change the config becausewell it's not a single block of textstill recognizes some of the names herebutwhich one would be the best let's seefully automatic page segmentationsingle columnof text of variable sizessingle single nothing single probablysparse textyeah i mean 11 we already tried this inthe command line i think 11 is good ithink 12 is good and i thinkuh these automatic things are good aswell so we can try something like uhlet's try three i'm not sure three isgoing to work well we can try itand we're probably going to get at leastbetter results than beforeuhnot the best but we got some pretty goodwe got microsoft paypal sonycanon kenwood mobileboss oracle yahoorolexso let's try withtwo you can play around with that againthis is just playing around you can youcan try and see which one gives you thebest resultsfor what you try to do what do we havehere we have a problem because this modeis not supported i guess so let's try11 again we already did thisbut yeahso let's seethere you go we can see a lot of texthereall right so let's try another imagelet's try the signs basically here wehave let me just see am i blockinganything no okayhere we basically have street signswhere we have village center width limitblandfords bettisbury whateverwe want to see if our model or if ourocr is going to be able to do that sowe're going to say signs dot jpg and forthis we're going to try to find asmuch text as possible so the samesettings as before we're going to runthisand what do we getwe get center we get upton we gotvillage we had spattersbury we gotblandfordabunch of different things yeah that'sbasically it but we don't get everythingbecause for example we didn't get widtheven though it was part i think we alsodidn't get limityeah so we didn't get everything thereagain we can play around with thedifferent modes uh but this is how youturn basic images uh or how you extractbasic strings from imagesnow what we can also do here is we canplot rectangles around the recognizedcharacters so we can see whichcharacters are recognized by the ocr andwhich are not and for this we're goingto have to changeuh the approach a little bit so we'regoing to say image equals cv to imreadso we're going to use opencv instead ofpillow because we're going to draw therectangles with opencv and we're goingto pass the file nameuh let's start with a simple onetext.jpgand then we're going to basically justextract the shape so we're going to sayshape uh heightuh width andchannels equalscv2or actually imagedot shape now i'm not even sure if we'regoing to need channels so let's turnthis into an underscore because i thinkit's just a return value that we don'tneedeven though i'm not sure about thatwe're going to seelater onumyeah so basically we get the height thewidth of the image and then we're goingto convert this image to boxes using pitesseract so we're going to say boxesequalspi tesseract dot image to boxes we'regoing to pass the image and the configmyconfig and let's look at the result tosee what we're actually working with sowe have boxes let's run thisand what you're going to seeis that we havethese individual boxes here so let'sscroll up quite a lot of boxes we havethe individual characters and we havethe coordinates so those coordinates arebasicallyuh the rectangle coordinates so we havetheuh upper left corner and the lower rightcorner i don't know what the lastparameters to be honestso we're going to ignore it anyways wedon't really need itand what we're going to do now is we'regoing to see four box in boxes dot splitlines so we havesplitlines so we have the individualuh characters as a separate box we'regoing to saybox equals box dot split onspaces on white spacesand then we're going to say cb2or actually image equals cb2dot rectanglewe're going to pass image and then we'regoing to pass hereuh for direct angle function we need topass point 1.2 which means upper leftcorner lower right corner and that'sgoing to draw a rectangle and here weneed to have integer ofbox 1 not 0 because 0 is the actualletterandthenum height minusinteger of box two because the height isinvertedandthen we're going to pass alsotheintegeroffboxthreeandheightminus integerof boxfour then we also need to pass a coloruh keep in mind here that we're workingwith a bgr color scheme in opencv notwith an rgb so it's not red green blueit's blue green red so if you pass 255 00 you're going to get blue and not redbut we're going to pass 0 to 55 0 whichdoesn't really matter because it's inthe middle so it's greenand then we're going to pass 2 in theend and we're going to display thiscb2 in showimage imageso this string can be chosen it's just atitle doesn't matter how you name it andthen cv2 weight keydelay of zeroso if we run this we should be able toseethe boxes there you go you can see theimage and the boxes around therecognized characters now i thinkthatuhthis here is not actually a character isitlet's seewhere's the textuh where was this actuallyor was it l i yeah then it's yeah it's lijust plotted above the characters okayso this works very simply orvery easily forthis particular image now let's apply itto logos to see what it recognizes thereand we're going to see that it's not asgoodas on the other image but it stillrecognizes quite a lot so it sees okayum this is recognized as two charactersso we see b and c but not really the iuh this is recognized as a character wecan see mastercard being recognized astwo characters samsung asks onecharacter and maybe a lambda in here oran swe can see that sony works paypal worksmicrosoft bosch worksuh yahoo works and so on sopartly it works probably not and nowlet's go to the actualsignsand we're going to see thatthere it doesn't work very wellat least it skips a lot or it finds alot that is not actually a character sothese two things are recognized this oneis recognized i don't understand whythis one is not recognizedthose two words here are also notrecognized but butuh we see here that a bunch ofleaves and a bunch oftrees are recognized as characters sothis is not optimal and of course youcan also let's go back to logos you canalso see how the results changeif you change the mode so let's say weassumeum well let's change 11 to somethinglike 2 or something like 3 for examplelet's change it to 3.we're going to see that the results arequite different theremaybe not for 3 and 11 oh actually thislooks a little bit betteryeah this actually looks way better thanjustusing 11 but if we now say okay weassume auh a uniform block of text so let's gowith sixthis is not going to work very well withthe logos because it's not a uniformblock of text obviouslybut actually it still works quite goodso let's let's pick the worst optionlet's say it's a single wordso let's change this to 8 and then we'reprobably going to see very bad resultshopefullyuh yeah there you go so if it thinksthat all this is a single word you cansee that the boxes are also uh not verywell placed so let's go back to 11anduh what we can now do as well is we cango ahead and not only plot boxes aroundindividual characters but aroundindividual words so we want to say okayuh obviously if we go to logos we willsee that certain characters belongtogether so ebay will not be recognizedas e b a and y it will be recognized asone block and thus as ebayand because of that we want to plotboxes around the individual words notjust the individual charactersnow for this what we're going to do iswe're going to remove all of this hereand i think we can keep thiscv2 in read stuffuh yeah this should work and then we'regoing to use a different function we'regoing to use the function image to dataso data is going to be pi tesseractimageto data and we're going to pass theimage we're going to pass the config andwe're going to pass an output type andfor this we're going tohave to import something we're going tohave to import from pi tesseractimport outputand we're going to chooseoutput dot and here you can see we canchoose data framewhich is i think a pandas data frame wecan choose dictionary we can choosebytes string whatever we're going to gowith a dictionary for today's videoandthen we're going to printthe datain order to see what we have in thereactually let's justcomment this out so we don't seeanythingand you can see here we have a level andwe have a bunch of values and then abunch of more stuff so maybe we shouldprint the keys to see what we have inhereso the key should give us informationabout what we can actually extract wehave level page number num parnum linenum word num left top width height conftext confis confidence text is theactual textand i think those are the things that weneed for the plotting of the boxesso let's go ahead and see what we havein datatextso that we see how this library actuallyworksandthere you go you see all the recognizedwords okay that's interestingso what we're going to do now is we'regoing to sayuh for or actually let's say amountamount of boxes is going to belengthof data textand then we're going to say for i inrange amount boxesand we're going to say if the floatversion of data confidence so if theconfidence is above a certain thresholdso let's say 80 for examplewhich is a confidence of 80 percent ifthe confidence is as high then we'regoing to plot a box because otherwise ifwe set the confidence too low it's justgoing to plot boxes everywhereso we're going to say if the confidencethat this is a word is above 80 we'regoing to sayx ywidthand heightare going to be data leftdata actually let's turn this into atupledatatopand of course we want to do this foreach instance so we need to provide i aswellhere as an indexthen datawhat was it withi and dataheightiso we're basically getting the top leftcorner of the rectangle and then thesize and this is enough of course toderivethe rectangle itselfand because of that we're going to gointo the next line and say image equalscv2 dot rectanglewe're going to plot on to the image andthe rectangle is going to start at x yand the lower right point is going to bex plus the widthand yplus the heightand of course don't forget the bgr colorscheme again255for green and then two againand then what we're also going to do iswe're going to put the textoff the images or the recognized textbelow the boxes now we can do it withoutas well so then you will already see theboxes around the textso if we run this we will already seethe result at least if we didn't makeany mistakes of course we did somefloat argument must be a string or anumber not a listuh i think we need to add an i hererightthere you gothere you go so now you can see therecognized words paypal sony hp ebaymicrosoft bosch oracle boss philips ckcanon and so onbut we don't see what the actualrecognized text is because maybe itmakes some mistakes maybe it says ck isa word but i see okayso in order to see what it actually doeswe're going to say cv2 dot put textonto the image we're going to put thetext which is data text we saw in thekeys that we have this textuh key and we're going topick of coursethe ith oneand we're going to place this text belowthe box so we're going to place it at xand y plus heightplus a little bit more 20 for examplewe're going to choose the font cv2 dotfontuh hershey simplexwe're going to pick a scale of 0.7so we're going to make it a little bitsmaller than the default we're going topick as a color 0 255 0.we're going to pick 2 as a thickness andwe're going to pick the last parameterswhich i forgot what it actually is for ithink it's optional but i chose in myprepared code line a8sothat should be actually enoughand we can run thishopefully i didn't block anythingi don't think soum but there you can see now what itactually recognizes philips ck boschmicrosoft paypal sony ebay uh here itrecognized i don't know what this is ohor i don't know what it iscanon mobile question mark for burgerkinguh gw for cnn which is you know i can'tunderstand this this could also be a wuh yeah so you can see what it actuallydoesnow in the case that iblocked the code this is the code let mejust close this this is the code we'rebasically plotting a rectangleand we're putting a textonto uh or below the box so let's swapthe image let's go with the signs to seeif it works as welllet's run thisand you see blandford spattersbury uptonvillage centerthen it says la in the trees here i meanthis could be la if youuh have a good imagination and of coursewe can also lower the confidence so wecan say okay if you areuh more than 20 confident then show memore and maybe we're going to get moretext based on thatum and you can see we get a lot moremisclassifications but not reallyanything useful so we don't getany of these words just because we lowerthe confidence but we get a hay up herein the tree so yeah that's not reallyintelligent in this case we can go tologos though and see if that changesanything so if we go to logos.jpgrun this again with a lower confidencethresholdyeah we can see way more uh but notnecessarily correct stuff so uh adidasis a suh then we have youtube wid so yeah it'snot reallya good thing but nvidia was classified ithink nvidia was not cloud uh notrecognized with a threshold of 80. butyeah you can play around with thesettings here this is how you do ocr inpythonso that's it for
